Server 1: This server will act as the primary web server and host the Nginx web server. Nginx will handle incoming HTTP requests, serve static files, and forward dynamic requests to the application server.

Server 2: This server will act as the secondary web server and will be identical to Server 1. Having two web servers ensures redundancy and high availability.

Server 3: This server will host the application server (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby), which will handle dynamic content generation and interact with the database.

Load Balancer (HAproxy): The load balancer's role is to distribute incoming traffic across the two web servers (Server 1 and Server 2) to ensure load balancing and high availability.

Application Files (Code Base): This is the set of code and files that make up the website's application. It includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code.

Database (MySQL): The database will be a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster. It consists of two nodes: the Primary node and the Replica node. The primary node is responsible for handling read and write operations, while the replica node(s) replicate data from the primary node and can handle read-only operations.

Explanation of Specifics:

Additional Servers: By adding two servers, we introduce redundancy and high availability. If one server fails, the other can take over, minimizing downtime and eliminating the Single Point of Failure (SPOF).

Load Balancer (HAproxy): The load balancer is essential to distribute incoming traffic across the two web servers, ensuring that the load is evenly distributed. This prevents one server from becoming overwhelmed and improves performance and responsiveness.

Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster: The database cluster consists of a Primary node and a Replica node. The Primary node handles read and write operations, while the Replica node(s) replicate data from the Primary node and can handle read-only operations. This setup improves read scalability and provides data redundancy.

Distribution Algorithm for Load Balancer (HAproxy): The load balancer can be configured with a Round Robin algorithm. With Round Robin, each incoming request is sequentially assigned to the next available server in the list. This ensures that each server receives an equal share of requests.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup: In this infrastructure, we have an Active-Active setup since both web servers (Server 1 and Server 2) are actively serving requests. If one server fails, the load balancer can reroute traffic to the other server, maintaining high availability.

Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster: In a Primary-Replica setup, the Primary node handles both read and write operations. When data is written to the Primary node, it is asynchronously replicated to the Replica node(s). Replica nodes only handle read operations, offloading read queries from the Primary node and improving overall database performance.

Difference between Primary and Replica Node for the Application: The application connects to the Primary node for all read and write operations. Write operations update the data in the Primary node, and then the data is asynchronously replicated to the Replica node(s). The application can optionally connect to Replica node(s) for read-only operations, which can help distribute read traffic and reduce the load on the Primary node.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Although we have redundancy for web servers and a database replica, the load balancer itself could be a potential SPOF. If the load balancer fails, it will disrupt the distribution of incoming traffic.

Security Issues: The infrastructure lacks a firewall, leaving the servers vulnerable to unauthorized access or attacks. Additionally, there's no HTTPS implementation, which means data transmission between users and servers is not encrypted, potentially exposing sensitive information.

No Monitoring: Without monitoring tools and systems in place, it will be challenging to detect and respond to performance issues, server failures, or potential security breaches promptly.

To improve the infrastructure, we would need to address these issues by adding a redundant load balancer, implementing firewalls and HTTPS, and setting up monitoring and alerting mechanisms. Additionally, we should also consider backup and disaster recovery solutions for the database to further enhance data resilience and availability.
