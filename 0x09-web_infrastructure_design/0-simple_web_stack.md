Server: A server is a computer system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In this case, our server will host all the components of the web infrastructure required to run the website.

Domain Name: The domain name, in this case, is foobar.com. It acts as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). When a user wants to access the website, they will type www.foobar.com into their web browser.

DNS Record: The www in www.foobar.com is a subdomain. In the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration, it will be represented as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. This record points to the main domain (foobar.com) or directly to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

Web Server (Nginx): The web server's role is to handle incoming HTTP requests from users' web browsers and respond with the appropriate web pages. In our case, Nginx will act as the web server software, serving static files and forwarding dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server: The application server is responsible for processing dynamic content and generating web pages. It interprets code (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) and interacts with the database to fetch or store data. In our setup, we will use a simple example code base for the application server.

Application Files (Code Base): This is the collection of code and files that make up the website's application. It can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code (e.g., PHP files) that define how the website behaves and looks.

Database (MySQL): The database is where the website stores and retrieves data. In our case, we will use MySQL as the relational database management system. It will be responsible for storing dynamic data such as user accounts, posts, comments, etc.

Communication with User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer via the HTTP protocol. When a user requests the website by typing www.foobar.com in their browser, a series of HTTP requests and responses are exchanged between the user's computer and the server.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since we have only one server, if it goes down or experiences any issues, the entire website will become inaccessible. There's no redundancy or failover mechanism in place.

Downtime during Maintenance: When maintenance is needed, such as deploying new code or updating the web server, the website will experience downtime. This can lead to a negative user experience and potential loss of traffic.

Limited Scalability: With only one server, the infrastructure cannot handle a large amount of incoming traffic. As the website gains popularity and user traffic increases, the server may become overwhelmed and slow down, leading to performance issues.

To address these issues, we could consider implementing solutions like:

Load Balancer: Introduce a load balancer in front of multiple servers to distribute incoming traffic evenly. This helps eliminate the SPOF and improves scalability.

High Availability: Set up redundant servers and databases in different geographic locations to ensure high availability and failover capabilities.

Continuous Deployment: Implement a continuous deployment system that allows code updates to be rolled out seamlessly without causing downtime.

Caching: Utilize caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the server and improve performance for frequently accessed content.

Content Delivery Network (CDN): Use a CDN to distribute static assets like images, stylesheets, and scripts, reducing the load on the web server and improving global accessibility.
